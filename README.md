# WorkdayScheduler

Description
I created a schedule for workday hours (between 9 AM and 5pm) that allows users to input a task in a time slot. Time slots in the past are listed in gray, the current time slot is listed in red, and future time slots are listed in green. This allows ease in scheduling events as each color coordinates to a certain times available to you and ones that are not.


## User Story
```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
